3 Books that Changed my Life
============================

I like to read books. I like to listen to books even more, because I can learn new things and discovering new worlds while driving, or with eyes closed (not at the same time).

You can check them out here. All highly recommended. But there are 3 that changed my life. Ideas that took my flat world-view and turned it inside out. Concepts that gave me the courage to live my own life.


1) The Art of Non Conformity.
-----------------------------

I've read this one two or three times. Written by the guy who decided not to live his life as the world expected him to, and instead travelled to every country on the globe. 

	When faced with uncertainty about taking a leap of faith; take the leap.


2) Living with Less.
--------------------

This book deserves a post of its own (until then, sign up on Joshua's website). #ANOC gave me the desire to take the road less travelled, this one gave me an appreciation for the flowers on the side of the path.

Materialism tells you that success is having everything you want. Minimalism counters that success is wanting everything you have.

	Minimalism can be summed up in this phrase: It is the intentional promotion of the things we most value and the removal of anything that distracts us from it.

My dad was a big believer in the Freedom of Simplicity. Of the joy of owning less and the luxury of sleeping under the stars... When you realise that your possesions own you (and not the other way round), having less means you have more; more time, more freedom and more love for life.


3) Man's Search for Meaning
---------------------------

This one is a real Life-Changer. If you are going through a rough patch this will give perspective from someone who survived the worst of the worst. And if you are cruising through life, it will give you a new appreciation for it.

This book addresses the basic human condition and grapples with the big questions of Life, the Universe and Everything. 

	He who has a WHY to live for can bear with almost any HOW.

It helped me realise that my "purpose" is not a static goal, but a framework for living that changes with the seasons of life.
