A quick post inspired by Tim Ferriss' 5 Bullet Friday

**What I'm Reading:** 
<br>_<a href="http://amzn.to/1WAyepX" target="_blank">How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big</a>_ by Scott Adams (you know - the guy who draws Dilbert). 

Fav Quote: "Goals are for losers. Systems are for winners." 
<br>Fascinating ideas on how to manage life and work and insight into Scott's life. Full review coming soon.

**Song of the Week:** 
<br>_<a href="https://soundcloud.com/sleepingatlast/north" target="_blank">North</a>_ by "Sleeping At Last".
Wow, just discovered this band. Great music to chill out with a glass of red wine and ponder the past week. And _<a href="https://soundcloud.com/sleepingatlast/son" target="_blank">Son</a>_.. goosebumps - the lyrics are really moving.

**Person of the week:** 
<br>_<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/etiennejeandevilliers" target="_blank">Etienne de Villiers</a>_
<br>Great to catch up with an old friend and brainstorm some crazy ideas. Etienne has built some amazing games and Augmented Reality apps!

**What I'm listening to:** 
<br>_<a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/2016/01/18/edward-norton-on-mastery-must-read-books-and-the-future-of-crowdfunding/" target="_blank">Tim Ferriss podcast with Ed Norton</a>._
<br>Great insight into the under-rated movies, <a href="https://www.crowdrise.com/" target="_blank">crowd funding</a> and more.

**Thought provoker:** 
<br>Sometimes a change of perspective can turn your whole world-view upside-down...
