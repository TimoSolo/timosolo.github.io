             w1="&lt;h3&gt;Conceptual Application&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will clearly remember the ten questions in the Shadowmatch worksheet where you were requested to resolve conceptual riddles. Shadowmatch wants to explain this. The Shadowmatch research team is of opinion that, amongst the majority of ordinary people (yes there are extra-ordinary people - Einstein, Mozart, Archimedes etc.) there is no such thing as intelligent and stupid people. Shadowmatch is convinced that some individuals have learned how to apply their minds to a problem, they like doing it, they practise this and they are fit in doing so. Others, despite the fact that they have the potential, have not learned how to apply their minds to a problem, they might not like doing it, they don't practise it and they haven't developed the habit of applying their minds to a riddle presented to them. Remember, this is exactly what Shadowmatch wants you to understand. It wants to know how fit and focussed are you to resolve a problem / riddle presented to you on a computer screen and how long does it take you to resolve these riddles. This is also an indication of your habit of working with problems towards successfully resolving them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have successfully resolved 10 of the ten riddles. This indicates that you are very successful with this type of problem solving. You've in total spent 7 minutes working on the ten riddles presented to you. It is obvious that you have learned how to successfully resolve such riddles successfully in a very short period of time and that your mind is very competent at working on these types of problems. This is amongst the best problem solving capabilities of all people in the Shadowmatch database.&lt;/p&gt;"  w2="&lt;h3&gt;Propensity to Own and Propensity to Hand-off&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking ownership of a job is an interesting habit we tend to either develop or not develop. People with a strong propensity to own a task given to them, run the risk of over committing themselves. They tend to take on too many things to do and they can easily over work and over commit themselves. This can then inevitably result in stress for the individual as well as a situation whereby too many expectations are created in terms of work performance. If you are not yet in such a situation, you are running the risk of exactly that. If something needs to be done, it is easy for you to accept the task / job as your responsibility. You have a strong propensity to rather own tasks instead of handing it to some outside agent to be done.&lt;/p&gt;"  w3="&lt;h3&gt;Propensity to Own and Propensity to Hand-off&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking ownership of a job is an interesting habit we tend to either develop or not develop. People with a strong propensity to own a task given to them, run the risk of over committing themselves. They tend to take on too many things to do and they can easily over work and over commit themselves. This can then inevitably result in stress for the individual as well as a situation whereby too many expectations are created in terms of work performance.

You have a strong propensity to rather own tasks instead of handing it to some outside agent to be done.&lt;/p&gt;"  w4="&lt;h3&gt;To Simplify&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shadowmatch should have asked you a few more questions to identify your specific behavior when simplification is needed in order to deal with challenges and problems that need to be resolved. Such questions could be: Do you enjoy making things easy to understand? Do you enjoy explaining complex issues in very simple terms? According to your Shadowmatch result on Simplification, you would have probably answered &quot;yes&quot; to both these questions. Why? Because you have a strong habit of Simplification. Your one strong method of dealing with problems and challenges is to simplify them and resolve the simple version of the problem in order to get the original problem resolved. For the majority of problems you need to resolve, simplification will be your natural first method. You will apply this method with minimal planning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your habit To Simplify will function best in the following situations:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;When you have full control over a situation and outside help is not possible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you have the opportunity to simplify the problem or challenge in a new and sometimes radical way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When you need to solve a riddle or a problem that is abstract and you need to break it down to simple concepts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"  w5="&lt;h3&gt;Resilience&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most reliable way of predicting behaviour is to determine if that specific behaviour has a pattern that could be identified as a habit. When a specific behaviour follows a strong predictable pattern, the propensity of the individual to repeat that behaviour when necessary is high. This is the case with your habit of Resilience. It is a strong habit that will in most situations enable you to relentlessly apply yourself to complete a task even when continuing with the task is tough. Your habit to this effect is strong enough to predict that you will have difficulty in giving up on a task if the slightest possibility of success exists. You are the type of person that will try again and again and even push yourself further than what others normally do in order to finish your job, complete the race or reach your goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resilience is a habit that can be supported by certain other behavioural patterns / preferences. The following comments need to be taken into account with regards to your resilience as a behavioural habit:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;When you can take full control of a situation, you will tend to be very resilient towards completion of the task.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When progress can be made through a simplified process that you can successfully implement, your energy towards finishing the task under challenging circumstances will be boosted.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"  w6="&lt;h3&gt;Propensity to Change&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your approach to change is predominantly a positive one. You have developed the habit of being comfortable with change. When life presents you with the opportunity to change or to stagnate and stay with the old ways, you will in the majority of instances rather change than stick to the old ways of doing things. When these changes become radical and it demands from you to do what you have never done before, you might experience some levels of stress. Despite this experience of stress, it will still be relatively easy for you to adapt. In the majority of situations change might even energise you. It will frustrate you when you have the opportunity to change and for some reason you are not in a situation to do so. A situation without dynamic change and movement towards improvement will not energise you.&lt;/p&gt;"  w7="&lt;h3&gt;Frustration Handling&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we get frustrated, we deal with the frustration. The way in which we deal with the frustration might be positive, negative or even passive. A frustration is something that prevents you from reaching your planned goal. Our behaviour when frustrated might become a behavioural pattern referred to as a habit.  A positive way of dealing with a frustration is when the individual engages with the reality of the frustration without losing control and without allowing the frustration to become a negative emotional experience. Negative frustration handling is when a person deals with frustrations in such a way that it becomes a negative experience for the individual as well as the people with him/her. Passive frustration handling is when one simply ignores the frustrations and let it play out by itself. Shadowmatch has identified your frustration handling behaviour to be positive but contextually selective. You handle specific types of frustrations in a positive way. These are the normal day-to-day frustrations. You have developed a habit of handling these day-to-day frustrations with some level of comfort but once the frustration becomes intense, your habit of positive engagement will be stretched. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shadowmatch wants to provide you with some very interesting feedback on the specific things in life that will tend to easily frustrate you:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;When you have to give a job to somebody knowing that you can do it better&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not being able to attend to important tasks quickly / immediately.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"  w8="&lt;h3&gt;Team and Individual Inclination&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working as an individual is a preference amongst those individuals with a sense of ownership towards doing a job. According to the way you've worked through the Shadowmatch worksheet, it is clear that you have a preference to rather work as an individual than to work in collaboration with a team. This preference is not such that you are uncomfortable with team interaction, it just indicates that in the majority of selected tasks, you prefer to work on your own, taking full ownership for the outcome and working predominantly independently towards the goal. Your independence is such that, for those selected jobs / tasks, you will only call for help once you cannot progress on your own.&lt;/p&gt;"  w9="&lt;h3&gt;Team and Individual Inclination&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working as an individual is a preference amongst those individuals with a sense of ownership towards doing a job. According to the way you've worked through the Shadowmatch worksheet, it is clear that you have a preference to rather work as an individual than to work in collaboration with a team. This preference is not such that you are uncomfortable with team interaction, it just indicates that in the majority of selected tasks, you prefer to work on your own, taking full ownership for the outcome and working predominantly independently towards the goal. Your independence is such that, for those selected jobs / tasks, you will only call for help once you cannot progress on your own.&lt;/p&gt;"  w10="&lt;h3&gt;Self-Motivation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whenever we have to find the energy to do something or to persist in doing a job, we need some form of motivation. Motivation can come from external sources or internal energy towards actions to be taken. Shadowmatch determines the level to which internal energy that results in a behavioural pattern is consistent enough to be referred to it as a habit. If you look at your graph, you will see that your Self-Motivation falls in the middle band. This indicates that your Self-Motivation is a contextual habit. It is a habit that functions when necessary towards the general tasks in your life. You might experience high levels of self-motivation but it will be towards specific tasks and not to all tasks and ventures that cross your path. &lt;/p&gt;"  w11="&lt;h3&gt;Routine&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the habit of building routine into our way of living is critical towards knowing why we do and don't do certain things. Routine can best be described as building a lifestyle of repetitive behavioural patterns. These might be things like doing the same job every day; travelling the same route to work every day, following the same routines when preparing to leave for work or church or anything else. You have developed a habit of flexible routine patterns in the way you live and work. This indicates that you prefer routine for those tasks that could be done with minimal planning and tasks that are not critically important to you. These routines have the purpose of making low key repetition tasks easy to execute and comfortable to manage. When things become critical for you, you prefer to first do them in a different way until it becomes a repetitive action, then cast these activities into routine behavioural patterns. You will tend to first find the pattern that works best for you before you do it as just another routine task. In short, for the less critical activities in your live, you have a strong habit of routine for the rest you prefer variety and diversity.&lt;/p&gt;"  w12="&lt;h3&gt;Problem Solving&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Success is the art of solving problems and enjoy the process&quot; (Anonymous 1887). The wise person who said this made a profound statement towards the way we understand our world. If we define problems as challenges we face when our plans are being met by obstacles that need active engagement and planning to resolve in order for us to successfully progress towards our goals, it makes sense to see problem solving as a key function towards success. You have indicated a strong habit towards solving problems. Your problem solving behaviour seems to be both broad and intense. This indicates that you are comfortable with a broad spectrum of problem types as well as a willingness to tackle complicated problems that are challenging to resolve. Your habit of Problem Solving is not radical but strong. This indicates that you will still choose not to engage with some problems. This will only happen when you are uncomfortable with the type and intensity of the problem you are faced with. Your habit is to solve the majority of everyday problems as well as a selection of problems outside of the everyday stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shadowmatch has a very advanced method of identifying the kind of problems we tend to face on a daily basis as well as what your comfort levels are towards resolving these classic problem types. The following could be identified:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The method that will work very well for you towards resolving problems, is to take a holistic view of the problem and to break it down into smaller problem units that are easier to resolve. It is a habit that you are already strong at.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You seem to be able to successfully resolve problems where conflict between people is the essence of the problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"  w13="&lt;h3&gt;Responsiveness&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The way you have worked through the Shadowmatch worksheet has indicated a very strong habit of Responsiveness. This indicates a behavioural pattern with a very strong preference of acting immediately (or very quickly if immediately is not possible) towards the vast majority of tasks on your to-do list. Shadowmatch defines habits that are this strong as radical. This means that you will have a very strong drive towards doing things immediately (if at all possible) in different scenarios and under a wide variety of circumstances. You will also expect other people to have the same urgencies towards work that needs to be done. When you are hampered towards freely living your habit of Responsiveness, you will be frustrated and you might place yourself in a very stressful situation because of your urgency to get everything done within a very short space of time.&lt;/p&gt;"  w14="&lt;h3&gt;Innovation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your habit of Innovation indicates a behavioural pattern with a strong preference towards doing things differently, trying new methods and promoting new technologies and products that have never been tried or used before. Although you have some areas where you still prefer to stay with the traditional and the known ways of doing things, you have indicated that, on an overall picture, you still prefer to work towards innovative ideas, concepts and products. Your behavioural patterns of innovation are strong and across many areas of life and work in general. People with a radical habit of Innovation are sometimes risk takers that make waves and even fiercely challenge the norm beyond reason in order to drive new concepts into reality. This is not where you are. You are responsible and positive towards innovative concepts and products and you prefer to have a specific innovation properly tested before you will go the full implementation route.&lt;/p&gt;"  w15="&lt;h3&gt;People Positive&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;People Positive is the behaviour of engaging with people in a very free and friendly way that works without conflict in a relationship free from stress and discomfort. When this behaviour becomes a pattern, Shadowmatch refers to it as a People Positive habit. The strength and focus of habits are very different. Your habit of People Positive behaviour is that of comfort, need and context. Shadowmatch will explain: You have the habit of working and relating very positively with people when you are in a comfortable space with them.  You will also show strong People Positive behaviour when necessary. When working positively with people is important, you can do it. As far as context goes, your People Positive habit is within you normal working and living circumstances. The place and space where you work and relate to people every day determines your People Positive behaviour. When you are in a comfortable space within yourself and with the people around you, and it is for some reason necessary for you to work with them positively, your habit of People Positive behaviour will be functional. This habit can therefore be described as functional but conditional within the context of your needs and the day-to-day realities you face.&lt;/p&gt;"  w16="&lt;h3&gt;Discipline&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shadowmatch defines Discipline as a strict, structured environment where we have to adhere to specific ways of doing things and even specific ways of acting in general. Your habit towards discipline is very clear to Shadowmatch. It can be described as soft, normal and necessary. Let's explain. 'Soft' indicates that you are very comfortable with soft structures of discipline with no radical rules or enforcement structures. 'Normal' indicates your comfort with the structures of order and regulations that are acceptable to society as ordinary and widely applied. 'Necessary' relates to the fact that under normal conditions you need normal structures of order and regulations (discipline). Under abnormal conditions like the military or a rescue operation you need stronger frameworks or regulations (discipline) because it is necessary. You are comfortable with discipline as needed. Your habit therefore is to easily follow the structures of preferably soft and normal structures of discipline as it is applicable and necessary for the situation.&lt;/p&gt;"  w17="&lt;h3&gt;Conflict Handling&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conflict situations do not scare you easily. You have developed a strong habit towards handling conflict. Shadowmatch is very clear about the fact that you will handle the vast majority of conflict situations and deal with every form of conflict in a positive manner. You tend to engage with people without fear. You have a strong pattern of behaviour of working towards a positive outcome that will be good for the situation and the people involved. It's relatively easy for you to deal with conflict. For the day-to-day conflict situations you don't need intense planning as you have the habit of working with conflict as a normal activity with little risk of allowing the conflict to get out of control. Your behavioural pattern indicates a habit of staying on top of a potentially conflicting situation with the aim to rather prevent it if possible. Your Conflict Handling habit is trans-contextual. This indicates positive conflict handling behaviour that is not strictly limited to a single environment or a specific type of conflict. Specific conflict types would be something like work related conflict, team conflict, family conflict etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shadowmatch could successfully identify the preferred way you act towards conflict. These indicators are not rules cast in stone but a very reliable indicator of a trend in your behaviour:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Your conflict engagement style will be to manage the situation towards a positive outcome for all in such a way that it doesn't happen again.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you experience that the above conflict management intervention doesn't work, you will most probably force the parties into some sort of settlement whereby they will have to submit themselves to your proposed solution to the conflict.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"  w18="&lt;h3&gt;Altruism&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altruism as the behaviour of helping other people in need without expecting any form of compensation either directly or indirectly, functions on different levels. For some it is a tough task, for others it is a duty they perform when really necessary and for some people it's a habit without borders and without judgement. For you it's a habit within the space of what you can (within reason) do and what needs to be done for people in a desperate situation. It's easy for you to help but there are some conditions to it. For people close to you it's easy for you to help and you do it without planning as routine type behaviour. For people you know and where their situation is not as a result of irresponsible behaviour, it will also be easy for you to help.&lt;/p&gt;"  w19="&lt;h3&gt;Self-Confidence&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes people tend to think about self-confidence as a feeling or an attitude. Shadowmatch defines Self-Confidence as a behaviour; the behaviour that shows that a person trusts his / her own abilities towards doing a job successfully. If this behaviour is strong and the individual displays it consistently as a pattern, it becomes a habit. You have interacted with the Shadowmatch worksheet in such a way that Shadowmatch could identify a strong pattern of Self-Confidence in a very wide range of tasks that were given to you. This constitutes a strong and broad habit of Self-Confidence. Strong in the sense that you have a well-established trust in the fact that you can successfully do things and that you will be able to handle difficult situations. Broad indicates the fact that you have a trust in your abilities towards a wide range of tasks that need to be done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shadowmatch can with confidence indicate the areas where your Self-Confidence will easily function without serious planning and consideration:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In situations where simple solutions are necessary to solve problems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When you have the opportunity to find a new way of doing things in order to improve.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When you can take ownership of a task that you are qualified to do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"  w20="&lt;h3&gt;Leadership&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leadership is a very complex behaviour to understand and Shadowmatch is not convinced that we fully understand it. Shadowmatch wants to share a few concepts with you. Some people are excellent leaders to small focussed groups of people doing a specific job. Others are good leaders for large political constituencies but they do not relate comfortably to smaller groups. Some are good leaders when their followers are young and some leaders can't work with young people. We must also note that some people are leaders without glamour. They take the lead in ordinary day-to-day situations and they get lots of things done as a result of their leadership role but it never reaches the headlines. This is your position. You will take the lead when necessary in the ordinary day-to-day activities of the less glamorous areas of life and work. Your leadership profile can thus be described as low key, situational and cautious. Be aware of the fact that your leadership habit is such that you can easily develop into a much more confident and mature leader, taking on much more leadership roles and responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;"  w21="&lt;h3&gt;Task Efficiency (88%)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all know that some people are very efficient in doing a job, some are less efficient and some are very in-efficient. Shadowmatch presents you with a task. This task consists of 70 questions of which ten are riddles that you need to resolve. It then tracks the time you've spent answering the questions and it tracks the time you've spent resolving the conceptual questions separately. The result is that the Shadowmatch system gathers very good information towards calculating how efficient you were in executing the task of completing the Shadowmatch worksheet. In order to be efficient, you also need to be accurate in what you do. The number of riddles you've resolved correctly thus plays a very important part in the algorithm being used to determine your efficiency profile. The population in the Shadowmatch database forms a statistical normal distribution graph displayed on your results page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to the population of thousands of individuals in the Shadowmatch database, you are in the top end of the efficiency profile. The reason for this is a combination of speed as well as the number of correct answers on the riddles you had to resolve. Remember, your efficiency is a combination of speed and accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;"  w22="&lt;h3&gt;Attitude&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attitude can best be described as the approach we take towards interacting with our environment. Shadowmatch breaks this up into four attitude categories. (Please study your Attitude Chart when reading this). Attitude Category One is that of an involved unaggressive approach. This attitude is one whereby the individual approaches his environment with the aim to get involved, to participate and engage without an agenda of aggressiveness or stubbornness. These people seek fulfilment in being part of an event, participating and reaching out with the aim to play a positive role towards a friendly engagement. Category Two people are also involved and participative; however they are assertive and sometimes even aggressive if things do not run according to their intended view or outcome. They participate but can easily confront people and take them to task. Category Three people are also assertive and sometimes aggressive, but they are not involved. They do not easily participate and they tend to rather disengage when things don't go their way. Category Four people are none of the above. They are not aggressive nor are they involved. They walk away, turn their backs on people and events that frustrate them and they tend to rather ignore than attend. Category Four dominant people tend to be aloof.  It is important to note that not one of us have only one approach to life, we have a combination of all four categories.Your Attitude shows strong behavioural patterns related to specific situations. The following behavioural patterns could be identified in relation to the four attitude categories:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attitude Category One: Strong. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This attitude is to engage and participate without forcing your agenda and without being aggressive in the situation. Your behaviour indicates strong involvement with strong participation towards success and positive results but with a preference towards a kind and friendly approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attitude Category Two: Soft. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your Category Two attitude is that of participation and engagement with a willingness to stand your ground and be assertive. You will not fight and become aggressive in a way that becomes destructive and dangerous - your approach is firm but within reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attitude Category Four: Soft. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will tend to approach your world with caution. If you are unsure of the situation, you might easily stay uninvolved or excuse yourself from participation. You will be comfortable to excuse yourself without getting into any form of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attitude Category Three: Absent. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Category Three behaviour is that of firm / aggressive and uninvolved. It indicates behavioural patterns of voicing frustrations without any action towards resolving the reason why you are frustrated. This is absent in your attitude. You will only in the very minority of situations voice and display your frustrations in a profound and active manner without any engagement towards resolving the issue. &lt;/p&gt;"         ></feedback></results>
